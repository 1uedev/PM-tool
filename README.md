# PM Copilot

AI-powered product management system for structured PM artifacts, traceability, and contextual assistance.

## What is PM Copilot?

PM Copilot is a structured product management workspace. It helps product managers capture, organise, and connect all the artifacts that make up a product — from the first problem statement to the final launch task — in a single, navigable system.

### Core idea

Traditional PM work is scattered across documents, Notion pages, and Jira tickets with no consistent structure and no traceability between decisions. PM Copilot gives every piece of information a **type**, a **status**, and **explicit links** to other artifacts. The result is a living graph of the product, where you can see how a business goal connects to a persona, a hypothesis, a feature, a user story, and an acceptance criterion — and spot what is missing.

### Domain model: 35 artifact types across 8 groups

Every item in the system is an **Artifact** with a type-specific set of fields, a status (Draft / In Review / Done), version history, comments, and relations to other artifacts.

| Group | Artifact types |
|---|---|
| **Foundations** | Goals & Non-Goals, Stakeholder, Assumption, Constraint, Open Question |
| **Research** | Market Analysis, Competitor, Research Finding, Problem Statement, Opportunity, Hypothesis, Problem Hypothesis |
| **Audience** | User Persona, Buyer Persona |
| **Strategy** | Product Vision, Value Proposition, Positioning, Business Model, KPI/OKR, Measurement Plan |
| **Discovery & Design** | Use Case, User Journey, Feature, Epic |
| **Delivery** | User Story, Functional Requirement, Non-Functional Requirement, Acceptance Criteria, Dependency, Risk, Decision, Test Plan, Compliance Requirement |
| **Planning & Release** | Roadmap Item, Release, Launch Task, Milestone |
| **Feedback & Iteration** | Feedback Item, Iteration |

### Key features

- **Explorer** — two-column view: artifact tree on the left (grouped, collapsible), structured edit form on the right; deep-linkable via URL params (`?artifact=ID`, `?new=TYPE`)
- **Relations** — explicit typed links between any two artifacts (Derives From / Depends On / Relates To / Validates); smart type suggestions based on source/target pair
- **Traceability view** — full artifact graph with gap detection, coverage bars per group, and filters by status, relation type, and visibility
- **Progress view** — completion overview per group and type; highlights missing or empty phases
- **Board view** — Kanban board (Draft / In Review / Done) with drag & drop; filterable by artifact type
- **Document import** — upload PDF, DOCX, TXT, or MD files; AI scans the content and proposes pre-filled artifacts (personas, vision, features, etc.); user reviews and selects which to create
- **AI suggestions** — per-artifact AI assist button (Claude or OpenAI); suggestions shown in a separate panel, never auto-applied; every suggestion requires explicit user acceptance
- **Version history** — every save creates a version; full diff and restore available
- **Search** — full-text search across all artifacts with type, status, and tag filters
- **Admin panel** — user management (create / edit / deactivate), language management (DE/EN), database configuration, AI provider configuration (provider + model + API key, effective without restart)
- **Role-based access** — system roles (Admin / User) and project roles (Owner / Editor / Viewer) with full enforcement in API and UI
- **Multilingual** — next-intl, cookie-based locale, no URL prefix; currently DE + EN
- **Account self-service** — users can update their display name and change their password at `/account`; account link in sidebar footer
- **Export** — download all project artifacts as JSON (full nested structure) or CSV (fixed columns + fields as JSON) from project settings
- **Relation pickers** — key fields (target user, actor, target segment, etc.) are formal relation pickers linking to Persona artifacts, not free-text; links appear automatically in graph and traceability

### Architecture notes for AI assistants

- **App Router only** — all pages are in `src/app/(dashboard)/` or `src/app/(auth)/`; no Pages Router
- **Server Components by default** — data fetching happens in page-level Server Components; Client Components are the leaf nodes that need interactivity
- **`src/lib/constants.js`** — single source of truth for all artifact types, groups, colors, status labels, relation types, and relation suggestions; always check here before adding new enums anywhere
- **`src/components/artifacts/fields/index.js`** — `FIELD_COMPONENTS` map; adding a new artifact type requires a new field component registered here
- **`src/lib/ai/prompts/index.js`** — `PROMPT_BUILDERS` map; every artifact type needs a prompt template here for the AI button to work
- **API pattern** — every route calls `requireAuth()` + `requireProjectAccess()` before any logic; responses are always `{ data }` or `{ error: { code, message } }`
- **Prisma + SQLite** — `fields` column is JSON (stored as TEXT in SQLite, Prisma handles serialisation); no raw SQL, all queries through Prisma client
- **SWR for client state** — mutations call the API, then `mutate()` the relevant SWR keys; no global state store

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Initialize database and seed demo data
npx prisma migrate dev
node prisma/seed.mjs

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Demo Credentials

| Email | Password | System Role | Project Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| admin@example.com | password123 | Admin | — |
| alice@example.com | password123 | User | Owner (Smart Home App) |
| bob@example.com | password123 | User | Editor (Smart Home App) |

### Environment Variables

`.env` is not checked in. Template:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-here"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# AI provider (fallback if no DB config exists)
# Configured via the Admin UI at /admin/ai
AI_PROVIDER="disabled"
AI_CLAUDE_API_KEY=""
AI_OPENAI_API_KEY=""
AI_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
AI_MAX_TOKENS=2048
```

> **Note:** AI provider, model, and API key are preferably configured through the Admin UI (`/admin/ai`) and stored in the database. Environment variables serve only as a fallback for initial startup.

### Useful Scripts

```bash
npm run db:seed       # Seed demo data
npm run db:reset      # Reset DB and re-seed
npx prisma studio     # Open database browser

npm test              # Run unit test suite (150 Vitest tests)
npm run test:e2e      # Run E2E suite (17 Playwright tests, requires dev server)
npm run test:watch    # Vitest watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Coverage report (HTML + text)
```

## Progress: Sprint 1

### Step 1 — Prisma Schema, Migration, Seed ✅

- Prisma 7 set up with SQLite adapter (`@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`)
- Full data model created: `User`, `Project`, `ProjectMember`, `Artifact`, `Relation`, `ArtifactVersion`, `Comment`, `Tag`, `ArtifactTag`, `AiSession`
- First migration applied (`prisma/migrations/…_init`)
- Seed script (`prisma/seed.mjs`) with demo data:
  - 2 users (alice & bob)
  - 1 project "Smart Home App"
  - 6 artifacts (all types, various statuses)
  - 3 relations between artifacts
  - One initial version per artifact
  - 1 comment
- `src/lib/prisma.js` — Prisma client singleton with adapter

---

### Step 2 — NextAuth Setup (Credentials Provider, JWT) ✅

- `src/lib/auth.js` — NextAuth config with Credentials Provider, bcrypt password verification, JWT session, custom login page `/login`
- `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js` — NextAuth API handler
- `src/lib/middleware/auth-guard.js` — `requireAuth()` helper for API routes
- `src/lib/errors.js` — `errorResponse()` / `successResponse()` for consistent API responses
- `src/middleware.js` — Next.js middleware automatically protects `/projects/*` and `/api/projects/*`
- `src/components/auth/SessionProvider.jsx` — client wrapper for `SessionProvider`
- Root layout wrapped with `SessionProvider`

**Implementation notes:**
- Kept Zod on v3 (next-auth v4 incompatible with Zod v4)
- Removed `"type": "module"` — ESM/CJS conflict with next-auth; using `.mjs` for seed and config instead
- `serverExternalPackages` for Prisma/bcryptjs prevents Webpack bundling errors

---

### Step 3 — Registration, Login, Logout (A1, A2, A3) ✅

- `POST /api/auth/register` — registration with Zod validation, bcrypt hashing, duplicate check
- `src/app/(auth)/layout.js` — centered auth layout without sidebar
- `/login` — `LoginForm` with `signIn()`, error display, loading indicator, redirect to `/projects`
- `/register` — `RegisterForm` with API call, auto-login after registration, field validation
- `LogoutButton` — `signOut()` → `/login`
- Root `/` redirects authenticated users to `/projects`, guests to `/login`
- New UI primitives: `Input`, `Spinner`, `Button` (revised)

---

### Step 4 — Auth Guard Middleware + Error Format (L1, L2, L3) ✅

- `src/lib/middleware/project-access.js`:
  - `requireProjectAccess(userId, projectId, requiredRole)` — checks membership + role (VIEWER / EDITOR / OWNER) with tenant isolation
  - `requireArtifactAccess(artifactId, projectId)` — ensures artifact belongs to the project
- `src/lib/validators/index.js`:
  - `validateBody(request, schema)` — parses JSON body and validates against Zod schema
  - `validateParams(searchParams, schema)` — validates URL query parameters
- `src/lib/constants.js` — all domain enums and labels (`PROJECT_STATUS`, `PROJECT_ROLE`, `ARTIFACT_TYPE`, `ARTIFACT_STATUS`, `RELATION_TYPE`)

**Pattern used across all API routes:**
```js
const { session, response: authErr } = await requireAuth();
if (authErr) return authErr;

const { membership, response: accessErr } = await requireProjectAccess(session.user.id, projectId, "EDITOR");
if (accessErr) return accessErr;

const { data, response: validErr } = await validateBody(request, mySchema);
if (validErr) return validErr;
```

---

### Step 5 — Project CRUD (B1, B2, B3, B4) ✅

**API:**
- `GET /api/projects` — project list with artifact count
- `POST /api/projects` — create project; creator is automatically OWNER
- `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/projects/:id` — details, edit (EDITOR+), delete (OWNER)
- `PATCH /api/projects/:id/archive` — archive / reactivate (OWNER)
- All routes secured with `requireAuth` + `requireProjectAccess`

**Frontend:**
- Dashboard layout with `Sidebar` (auth gate, Server Component)
- `/projects` — project grid, active + archived sections, empty state
- `/projects/new` — form with validation
- `/projects/:id/settings` — edit + actions (archive, delete with confirmation dialog)
- New components: `ProjectCard`, `ProjectList`, `ProjectForm`, `ProjectSettingsActions`
- New UI primitives: `Badge`, `ConfirmDialog`, `Sidebar`, `Header`, `EmptyState`

---

### Step 6 — Explorer Layout (C1) ✅

Two-column layout for `/projects/:id`:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Breadcrumb                  Settings   │  ← Header
├──────────────┬──────────────────────────┤
│ Artifacts    │                          │
│              │                          │
│ USER PERSONA │   Detail panel           │
│  • Persona A │                          │
│              │   → empty: hint text     │
│ PROBLEM HYP. │   → ?artifact=ID: form   │
│  • Hyp. B    │   → ?new=TYPE: create    │
│              │                          │
│ USE CASE (0) │                          │
│  None...     │                          │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

- `ExplorerTree` (Server Component) — groups artifacts by type in canonical order
- `ExplorerTreeGroup` — collapsible group with item count and `+` button (on hover)
- `ExplorerTreeItem` — entry with status dot (green / yellow / grey), sets `?artifact=ID` in the URL
- `ExplorerDetail` (Client Component) — reads URL params, shows context-appropriate content
- `GET /api/projects/:id/artifacts` — list of all non-deleted artifacts, optional `?type=` filter
- URL params as state (`?artifact=ID`, `?new=TYPE`) — deep-linkable, no extra client state

---

### Step 7 — Create and Edit Artifacts (D1, D2) ✅

**API:**
- `POST /api/projects/:id/artifacts` — creates artifact + version 1 in a transaction, merges fields with type defaults
- `GET /api/projects/:id/artifacts/:aid` — full artifact with parsed JSON fields
- `PATCH /api/projects/:id/artifacts/:aid` — update with automatic versioning

**Frontend:**
- `ArtifactForm` — unified create/edit form:
  - Title + status select in header
  - All fields for the type as labeled inputs / textareas
  - Optimistic save feedback ("✓ Saved")
  - On create: redirect to `?artifact=ID`
- `ExplorerDetail` (live):
  - `?artifact=ID` → SWR fetch → `ArtifactForm` (edit mode)
  - `?new=TYPE` → `ArtifactForm` (create mode)
  - Empty → hint text
- `ExplorerTreeClient` — client wrapper with SWR revalidation after mutations, server-rendered initial data as fallback

**Shared:**
- `src/lib/artifactFields.js` — field definitions (key, label, placeholder, multiline, rows) for all 6 artifact types + `getDefaultFields()`
- `src/lib/validators/artifact.js` — Zod schemas for create and update
- `Select` UI primitive

---

### Step 8 — Type-Specific Field Components (D3) ✅

A dedicated field component for each of the 6 artifact types with type-appropriate UX:

| Component | Highlight |
|---|---|
| `UserPersonaFields` | Name, goals, pain points, context as labeled fields |
| `ProblemHypothesisFields` | Visual divider between problem section and hypothesis section |
| `ProductVisionFields` | One-liner in a highlighted blue box |
| `UseCaseFields` | Actor + goal side by side, flow in monospace textarea |
| `UserStoryFields` | Classic "As a … I want … so that …" format with connected display |
| `FunctionalRequirementFields` | Acceptance criteria in monospace textarea with hint text |

- `FieldHelpers.jsx` — shared primitives: `FieldLabel`, `FieldInput`, `FieldTextarea`, `FieldGroup`, `SectionDivider`
- `fields/index.js` — `FIELD_COMPONENTS` map for dynamic rendering by type
- `ArtifactForm` — generic renderer removed, now uses `FIELD_COMPONENTS[artifactType]`

---

### Step 9 — Artifact Status and Soft Delete (D4, D5) ✅

**D4 — Status management:**
- `ArtifactHeader` — shows type label + `ArtifactStatusBadge` + quick status button
- Quick status toggle: one click cycles DRAFT → IN_REVIEW → DONE → DRAFT, immediately writes a new version, invalidates SWR cache in tree and detail panel
- Status button shows the next target status as its label

**D5 — Soft delete:**
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id/artifacts/:aid` — sets `deleted: true`; record is physically retained
- Delete icon in `ArtifactHeader` opens `ConfirmDialog` with artifact title
- After confirmation: SWR cache invalidated, redirect to empty explorer, tree refresh
- All standard queries already filter `deleted: false` — deleted artifacts no longer appear

---

### Step 10 — Explorer Tree: Navigation and Unsaved-Changes Guard (C2, C3) ✅

**C2 — Navigation:**
- Clicking a tree entry sets `?artifact=ID` in the URL → detail panel loads the artifact via SWR
- Clicking `+` in a group sets `?new=TYPE` → new artifact form
- **Unsaved-changes guard** (spec rule 7): if the form is dirty and the user navigates away (different artifact, + new, leave page), a `ConfirmDialog` appears — "Discard and switch" or "Cancel"
- `DirtyFormContext` — React context, reads/writes `isDirty` globally across `ArtifactForm`, `ExplorerTreeItem`, and `ExplorerTreeGroup`
- `ArtifactForm` sets `isDirty = true` on any field change, `isDirty = false` after a successful save or when switching to another artifact (via `useEffect` on `artifact.id`)

**C3 — Grouping:**
- 6 groups in canonical order: Persona → Hypothesis → Vision → Use Case → Story → Requirement
- Each group: collapsible, shows artifact count, `+` button on hover
- Empty groups show "No entries" (no visual noise)
- Status dot per item: green (Done), yellow (In Review), grey (Draft)

---

## Sprint 1 Complete ✅

All 10 steps of Sprint 1 are implemented.

---

## Progress: Sprint 2

### Step 1 — Create Relations (E1) ✅

**API:**
- `GET /api/projects/:id/artifacts/:aid/relations` — loads all relations (from and to this artifact), including linked artifact metadata
- `POST /api/projects/:id/artifacts/:aid/relations` — creates a new relation (duplicate check, self-reference check)
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id/artifacts/:aid/relations/:rid` — deletes relation (verifies it belongs to the artifact)

**Frontend:**
- `RelationList` — displays all links below the artifact form; each row with delete button and `ConfirmDialog`
- `RelationAddDialog` — modal for selecting relation type and target artifact
- `ExplorerDetail` — integrates `RelationList` below the form

**Shared:**
- `src/lib/validators/relation.js` — Zod schema for creating a relation

---

### Step 2 — Comments (G1, G2) ✅

**API:**
- `GET /api/projects/:id/artifacts/:aid/comments` — loads all comments chronologically (oldest first), including author data
- `POST /api/projects/:id/artifacts/:aid/comments` — adds a new comment (VIEWER+ may comment)

**Frontend:**
- `CommentList` — displays comment thread below relations; avatar initials, name, and timestamp per entry
- `CommentForm` — textarea with send button, optimistic update via SWR mutate
- `ExplorerDetail` — integrates `CommentList` after `RelationList`

**Shared:**
- `src/lib/validators/comment.js` — Zod schema (min 1, max 2000 characters)

---

### Step 3 — Role-Based Access Control (L1, L2) ✅

**Concept:** VIEWER = read access, EDITOR = edit, OWNER = project settings

**`ProjectRoleContext`** (`src/lib/ProjectRoleContext.js`):
- React context with `ProjectRoleProvider` + `useProjectRole()` hook
- `hasRole(userRole, requiredRole)` checks role hierarchy (VIEWER < EDITOR < OWNER)

**Frontend gating:**
| Component | VIEWER | EDITOR | OWNER |
|---|---|---|---|
| Settings button | hidden | hidden | visible |
| `+` button in tree | hidden | visible | visible |
| Status toggle + delete | hidden | visible | visible |
| Form fields | disabled | editable | editable |
| Save button | hidden | visible | visible |
| Add/remove relations | hidden | visible | visible |
| Comment | allowed | allowed | allowed |

**Backend:** Already implemented in `requireProjectAccess()` — all write endpoints require EDITOR+, project management requires OWNER.

---

## Sprint 2 Complete ✅

---

## Progress: Sprint 3

### Step 1 — AI Provider Adapter + Suggestions (F1–F5) ✅

**Backend:**
- `src/lib/ai/provider.js` — base interface `AiProvider`
- `src/lib/ai/claude-adapter.js` — Claude adapter (`claude-sonnet-4-6`), timeout handling
- `src/lib/ai/provider-factory.js` — `getAiProvider()` + `isAiAvailable()` (checks API key)
- `src/lib/ai/prompts/` — 6 prompt templates (one per artifact type), JSON output format
- `src/lib/ai/prompts/index.js` — `buildPrompt()` + `parseSuggestions()` with JSON parse fallback
- `POST /api/.../ai` — request suggestions, linked artifacts as context, AiSession logging (F4)

**Frontend:**
- `AiSuggestButton` — purple button in the form (edit mode only, EDITOR+ only); shows loading indicator
- `AiSuggestionPanel` — separate panel with all suggestions, "Accept all" button (F2, F3)
- `AiSuggestionItem` — individual suggestion with ✓ button; removed from panel after acceptance (F3)
- Guardrails (F5): AI never auto-applies changes; every suggestion requires explicit acceptance

**Configuration:**
- Set `AI_CLAUDE_API_KEY` in `.env` — without a key the button stays disabled (503)
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` added to `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.mjs`

---

### Step 2 — Version History (H1, H2, H3) ✅

**H1** — Versioning on save: already implemented in Sprint 1 — every PATCH automatically creates a new `ArtifactVersion`.

**API:**
- `GET /api/.../versions` — all versions (newest first) including author data and parsed fields
- `POST /api/.../versions/:vid` — restore version: resets artifact content and creates a new version

**Frontend (`VersionList`):**
- Collapsible section below comments
- Current version with blue "Current" badge
- Each version expandable → shows fields as preview
- Restore button (EDITOR+ only) with `ConfirmDialog`
- After restore: SWR cache for artifact, versions, and tree invalidated

---

### Step 3 — Progress View (I1, I2) ✅

**API:**
- `GET /api/projects/:id/progress` — aggregates stats per artifact type: `total`, `done`, `inReview`, `draft`, `progress%`, `missing` flag; plus overall stats (`overallProgress`, `missingTypes`)

**Frontend:**
- `ProgressOverview` — summary bar (overall progress %, count done, missing phases) + grid of phase cards
- `PhaseCard` — per artifact type: progress bar, status breakdown (dots in green/yellow/grey), orange warning for missing phases, CTA link to create
- `/projects/:id/progress` — server-rendered page for fast initial render
- "Progress" button (BarChart3 icon) in explorer header visible to all roles

---

## Sprint 3 Complete ✅

---

## Progress: Sprint 4

### Step 1 — Full-Text Search (K1) ✅

- `GET /api/projects/:id/search?q=&type=&status=&tag=` — LIKE search over title and `fields` JSON, combinable with type, status, and tag filters
- `SearchDialog` — command palette modal with 250ms debounce, keyboard navigation (↑↓↵Esc), snippet preview from field content
- `SearchButton` — opens dialog; global ⌘K/Ctrl+K shortcut
- Search button in explorer header visible to all roles

---

### Step 2 — Tags and Tag Filtering (K2, K3) ✅

- `GET/POST /api/projects/:id/tags` — manage project tags (upsert by name)
- `GET/POST/DELETE /api/projects/:id/artifacts/:aid/tags` — assign/remove tags
- `TagEditor` — inline tag chip editor in ArtifactHeader: dropdown with existing tags, "Create tag" option, remove via X
- Tag filter dropdown in SearchDialog (shown when project has tags)

---

### Step 3 — Status Filter in Explorer Tree (K3) ✅

- Filter bar at the top of the artifact tree: All / Draft / In Review / Done
- Client-side filter with no extra API call
- Active filter highlighted with a blue pill badge

---

### Step 4 — Board View with Drag & Drop (J1, J2) ✅

- `BoardCard` — draggable card using the native HTML5 Drag & Drop API
- `BoardColumn` — drop zone per status, visual highlight on drag-over, empty state
- `BoardView` — 3 columns (Draft / In Review / Done), optimistic status update via PATCH, type filter toolbar
- Clicking a card opens the artifact in the explorer (`/projects/:id?artifact=ID`)
- `/projects/:id/board` — board page with breadcrumb; board button in explorer header

---

### Step 5 — Error Boundaries and Hardening (L3) ✅

- `(dashboard)/error.js` — React error boundary for all dashboard pages with reset/back button
- `(dashboard)/not-found.js` — 404 page for unknown project/artifact IDs
- `app/not-found.js` — minimal root 404 for unknown top-level routes
- Backend validation (Zod), tenant isolation, and roles fully implemented

---

## Sprint 4 Complete ✅

## MVP Fully Implemented ✅

All P0 features from the spec are implemented:

| Sprint | Features |
|---|---|
| Sprint 1 | Auth (A1–A3), project management (B1–B4), explorer (C1–C3), artifact CRUD (D1–D5) |
| Sprint 2 | Relations (E1–E3), comments (G1–G2), roles (L1–L2) |
| Sprint 3 | AI suggestions (F1–F5), version history (H1–H3), progress view (I1–I2) |
| Sprint 4 | Search (K1), tags (K2), filters (K3), board view (J1–J2), error handling (L3) |

---

## Extension: Full Product Model

### Extension Step 1 — Admin-Only User Management ✅

**What was implemented:**
- Global role concept `systemRole` (`ADMIN` | `USER`) on the User model, separate from project roles
- User `status` (`ACTIVE` | `INACTIVE`) — soft deactivation instead of physical deletion
- Inactive users cannot log in (auth check in `authorize()`)
- Admin-only middleware (`requireAdmin`) protects all admin routes server-side

**New domain fields on User:**
- `firstName`, `lastName` — structured name
- `systemRole` — system-wide role (`ADMIN` / `USER`)
- `status` — account status (`ACTIVE` / `INACTIVE`)

**New API endpoints (admin-only):**
- `GET  /api/admin/users` — user list
- `POST /api/admin/users` — create user
- `GET  /api/admin/users/:id` — user detail
- `PATCH /api/admin/users/:id` — edit user (incl. password reset)
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` — deactivate user (soft delete)

**New UI areas:**
- `/admin/users` — user list with status badges, activate/deactivate
- `/admin/users/new` — create user (first name, last name, email, password, role, status)
- `/admin/users/:id/edit` — edit user
- Sidebar: admin section visible only to admins (`Administration > User Management`)

**Known limitations:**
- No email flows (no password reset by email, no invitation logic)
- Self-service registration remains active (can optionally be disabled)
- No audit log for admin actions (planned for later steps)

---

### Extension Step 2 — Domain Model: 26 PRD Object Types ✅

**What was implemented:**
- 20 new artifact types (no DB migration needed — types stored as strings)
- Domain group structure (7 groups) instead of an alphabetical type list
- Explorer navigation with two-level structure: Group → Type → Artifacts
- Field definitions for all 26 types

**New domain objects:**

| Group | Types |
|---|---|
| Research | Market Analysis, Competitor, Research Finding, Problem Statement, Opportunity, Hypothesis |
| Audience | User Persona *(existing)*, Buyer Persona |
| Strategy | Product Vision *(existing)*, Value Proposition, Positioning, Business Model, KPI/OKR |
| Discovery & Design | Use Case *(existing)*, User Journey, Feature, Epic |
| Delivery | User Story *(existing)*, Functional Requirement *(existing)*, NFR, Acceptance Criteria, Dependency, Risk, Decision |
| Planning & Release | Roadmap Item, Release, Launch Task |
| Feedback & Iteration | Feedback Item, Iteration |

**New UI areas:**
- Explorer tree: two-level group navigation — collapsible group → collapsible type
- `ExplorerGroupSection` — new component for group headers with total count
- All new types immediately creatable and editable in the explorer (generic form)

**No API change needed** — existing artifact CRUD endpoints work for all types.

**Known limitations:**
- Type-specific field components (with specialized UX) not yet available for all new types — generic form used as fallback
- Progress view now shows all 26 types (can become long with many empty phases)

---

### Extension Step 3 — Generalized Relations + Traceability ✅

**What was implemented:**

**Smart relation suggestions:**
- `RELATION_SUGGESTIONS` in `constants.js` — map `[sourceType][targetType] → recommended relation type` for all 26 artifact types
- `RelationAddDialog` revised:
  - Target artifact selected first (better UX ordering)
  - Candidates grouped by domain group (Research / Audience / Strategy / …) via `<optgroup>`
  - Relation type auto-suggested once target is chosen; "(recommended)" hint shown
  - Manual override always possible

**New Traceability view:**
- `GET /api/projects/:id/traceability` — returns all artifacts + all relations (source direction only for efficiency)
- `TraceabilityView` component — grouped overview of all artifacts with their connections:
  - Summary bar: total / connected / isolated / relation count
  - Per group (7 domain groups): collapsible section with color coding
  - Per artifact: connections as colored badges with arrow direction, clickable → explorer
  - Isolated artifacts (no connections) visible but dimmed
- `/projects/:id/traceability` — new page, server-rendered
- New "Traceability" button (`GitBranch` icon) in explorer header

---

### Extension Step 7 — Review / Hardening ✅

**Critical bugfix — AI prompts for all 26 artifact types:**

This was the most severe remaining bug: all 20 new artifact types had **no prompt templates** — every AI suggestion request for a new type resulted in a 500 error ("No prompt builder for type: FEATURE").

**20 new prompt templates created** (`src/lib/ai/prompts/`):

| Group | New templates |
|---|---|
| Research | market-analysis, competitor, research-finding, problem-statement, opportunity, hypothesis |
| Audience | buyer-persona |
| Strategy | value-proposition, positioning, business-model, kpi-okr |
| Discovery | user-journey, feature, epic |
| Delivery | non-functional-requirement, acceptance-criteria, dependency, risk, decision |
| Planning | roadmap-item, release, launch-task |
| Feedback | feedback-item, iteration |

**Each template includes:**
- Product Manager role description
- Current field values in prompt context
- Exact JSON output format with the correct field keys
- Type-specific quality rules (e.g. OKR format, Given/When/Then, mitigation strategies)

**Upstream validation in AI route:**
- `hasPromptBuilder()` export in `prompts/index.js`
- AI route now checks the type **before** the provider call
- Returns 400 with a clear message instead of 500 for unknown types (safety net)

---

### Extension Step 6 — Improved Traceability ✅

**What was implemented:**

**Bugfix — SQLite query:**
- `traceability/page.js` was using `OR: [{ source: { projectId } }, { target: { projectId } }]` — the same nested filter pattern that caused SQLite hangs in the traceability API route
- Fix: two-step query (fetch artifact IDs first, then `sourceId: { in: [...] }`) — consistent with the API route

**Filter toolbar:**
- **Visibility filter** (All / Connected only / Isolated only) — clickable pills; summary bar numbers are also clickable and set the filter
- **Group filter** — colored pill buttons for all 7 domain groups (only shown when group has artifacts); toggle logic (click again = back to All)
- **Expand/Collapse All** — two buttons ("Expand all" / "Collapse all") control all group sections simultaneously via `forceOpen` prop

**Relation type visible in badge:**
- Connection badges now explicitly show the relation type ("Derived from:", "Validates:", "Depends on:") before the artifact title
- Direction arrow (← / →) still visible
- Type label of the linked artifact shown inline for better orientation

**Isolated artifacts:**
- Summary bar: isolated count in orange (when > 0) instead of grey — clickable as quick filter
- Group header: shows a separate "X isolated" badge when the group has isolated artifacts

---

### Extension Step 4 — Explorer / Navigation Improvements ✅

**Problem:** With 26 artifact types across 7 groups, the explorer tree became unwieldy — all type groups started expanded, even with 0 entries.

**What was implemented:**

**Explorer tree:**
- `ExplorerTreeGroup` — type groups with 0 artifacts now start **collapsed** (previously: always open → 26 "No entries" rows visible)
- `ExplorerGroupSection` — domain groups also start collapsed when empty
- Group headers with color-coded type accents (one color per group) and colored count badge
- `ARTIFACT_GROUP_COLORS` in `constants.js` — central color token schema for all 7 groups (bg, text, dot, border, header, badge); used consistently across explorer, progress, and traceability

**Progress view:**
- `ProgressOverview` rebuilt: instead of 26 type cards in a flat grid, cards are now **grouped by the 7 domain groups**
- Each group has a colored header with total artifact count and group-level progress bar (% done)
- Empty groups show "No entries" in the header rather than disappearing entirely

**Board view:**
- Type filter now only shows types that **actually have artifacts** (instead of all 26 as a flat button row)
- Canonical type order (via `ARTIFACT_GROUPS`) instead of alphabetical

**Traceability:**
- `TraceabilityView` now uses `ARTIFACT_GROUP_COLORS` from `constants.js` instead of local color maps — consistent coloring guaranteed

---

### Extension Step 5 — Detail Views and Editors for All Object Types ✅

**What was implemented:**

Dedicated, type-specific field components were created for all 20 new artifact types. Each type has a UX tailored to its domain context — with highlights, grid layouts, and structured input formats.

**New field components (20 types, 24 components total):**

| Group | Component | Highlight |
|---|---|---|
| Research | `MarketAnalysisFields` | Summary + market size + trends/sources grid |
| Research | `CompetitorFields` | Name + SWOT grid (strengths/weaknesses side by side) + positioning |
| Research | `ResearchFindingFields` | Insight + method/participants grid + implications |
| Research | `ProblemStatementFields` | Problem + context divider + impact/workaround grid |
| Research | `OpportunityFields` | Description + target audience + value/timing grid |
| Research | `HypothesisFields` | Structured card flow: "We believe → because → Test: → Confirmed when" with connecting arrows |
| Audience | `BuyerPersonaFields` | Name/role grid + profile divider + goals/pain points/buying criteria |
| Strategy | `ValuePropositionFields` | Highlighted blue statement box + target customer + benefits/differentiation grid |
| Strategy | `PositioningFields` | Highlighted purple statement box with template hint + segment/advantage/key message |
| Strategy | `BusinessModelFields` | Revenue/cost grid + channels/partners grid |
| Strategy | `KpiOkrFields` | Highlighted amber objective box + key results + metrics + period/owner grid |
| Discovery | `UserJourneyFields` | Actor/scenario grid + journey steps (large) + pain points/opportunities side by side |
| Discovery | `FeatureFields` | Description + benefit + scope divider + in-scope/out-of-scope grid + priority |
| Discovery | `EpicFields` | Description + goals + scope divider + scope + success criteria |
| Delivery | `NonFunctionalRequirementFields` | Description + category/metric grid + acceptance divider |
| Delivery | `AcceptanceCriteriaFields` | Highlighted teal Given/When/Then box (monospace) + preconditions + outcome |
| Delivery | `DependencyFields` | Description + from/type grid + consequences divider + impact + owner |
| Delivery | `RiskFields` | Description + probability/impact grid + mitigation divider + mitigation + owner |
| Delivery | `DecisionFields` | Context + highlighted indigo decision box + rationale + alternatives/consequences |
| Planning | `RoadmapItemFields` | Description + timeframe + context divider + features + rationale |
| Planning | `ReleaseFields` | Version/date grid + description + content divider + scope + release notes |
| Planning | `LaunchTaskFields` | Description + owner/date grid + checklist divider |
| Feedback | `FeedbackItemFields` | Source/sentiment grid + content + actions divider |
| Feedback | `IterationFields` | Description + learnings + next steps divider + improvements + next steps |

**Infrastructure:**
- `fields/index.js` — `FIELD_COMPONENTS` map fully extended to all 30 types (6 legacy + 24 new)
- `ArtifactForm` uses `FIELD_COMPONENTS[type]` — all types automatically rendered with their specialized form
- No generic fallback rendering needed

---

### Bugfix — Project Settings: Event Handler Prop Error ✅

**Problem:** The settings page `/projects/:id/settings` threw "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props" on load. Cause: the Server Component `page.js` was passing a function (`onInvited`) directly to the Client Component `InviteMember`.

**Fix:**
- New Client Component `MembersSection` created as a wrapper — holds the SWR `mutate` call internally
- `page.js` only passes serializable props (`projectId`, `isOwner`) to `MembersSection`
- `MembersSection` invalidates the SWR cache (`/api/projects/:id/members`) itself after a successful invitation

---

### Extension Step 8 — Multilingual Support (DE / EN) ✅

**Goal:** Admins manage available languages; users choose their preferred display language. No URL prefix — locale is set via cookie.

**Data model:**
- New `Language` model: `code`, `name`, `nativeName`, `isActive`, `isDefault`
- `User.preferredLanguage` — stored language preference per user
- Seed: German (`de`, default) + English (`en`)

**Infrastructure (next-intl):**
- `next-intl` installed and integrated via `createNextIntlPlugin` in `next.config.mjs`
- `src/i18n/request.js` — reads `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie, falls back to `de`
- `src/app/layout.js` — `NextIntlClientProvider` wraps the entire app
- `messages/de.json` + `messages/en.json` — translation keys for nav, auth, common, admin, projects, artifact status

**Admin — Language management (`/admin/languages`):**
- Table of all languages with status badge and default marker
- Actions per language: set as default (⭐), activate/deactivate (👁), delete (🗑)
- Guard: default language cannot be deactivated or deleted
- Form for adding new languages (code / English name / native name)
- API: `GET/POST /api/admin/languages`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/admin/languages/[code]`

**User — Language selection:**
- `LanguagePicker` in sidebar footer — popover with all active languages, checkmark on current
- Language switch: `PATCH /api/users/me/language` → writes `User.preferredLanguage` to DB + sets `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie (30 days)
- Takes effect immediately via `router.refresh()` without a full reload

**Translations applied:**
- `Sidebar` — all nav labels via `useTranslations()`
- `LogoutButton` — "Abmelden" / "Log out"

---

### Extension Step 9 — Database Configuration UI ✅

**Goal:** Admins can configure the database connection for production deployment — directly in the UI, without manually editing files.

**Admin page (`/admin/database`):**
- **DB type selector:** SQLite / PostgreSQL / MariaDB (card-style picker with descriptions)
- **SQLite:** file path input (relative or absolute)
- **PostgreSQL / MariaDB:** host, port, database name, username, password — or toggle to enter a raw connection URL directly
- **`DATABASE_URL` preview** — generated live, password masked, copy button
- **Test connection** — establishes a real connection (`pg` / `mysql2`, 5s timeout), reports server version on success
- **Save configuration** — writes `DATABASE_URL` to `.env.local` (overrides `.env` without modifying it)
- **Post-save checklist** — collapsible, with copy buttons for all required follow-up steps:
  1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma` provider
  2. Install adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg` / `@prisma/adapter-mysql`)
  3. `npx prisma migrate deploy`
  4. Restart the server

**New packages:** `pg`, `mysql2`

**New utility:** `src/lib/env-config.js` — parse and write `.env` files, URL builder/parser, DB type detection

**API:** `GET/PATCH /api/admin/database`, `POST /api/admin/database/test`

> **Limitation:** Switching databases still requires a server restart and manual Prisma schema update. The UI covers configuration, not automatic migration.

---

### Extension Step 10 — AI Provider Configuration UI ✅

**Goal:** Admins select the AI provider, model, and API key directly in the UI. Changes take effect **immediately without a restart** — configuration is stored in the database and loaded dynamically on every AI request.

**Data model:**
- New `AiConfig` model (singleton, `id = "singleton"`): `provider`, `model`, `apiKey`, `timeoutMs`, `maxTokens`
- Provider factory reads from DB first, falls back to environment variables

**Admin page (`/admin/ai`):**
- **Provider selection:** Anthropic Claude / OpenAI / Disabled
- **Model selection** (radio buttons with recommendation badges):
  - Claude: Opus 4.6 (Powerful), **Sonnet 4.6 (Recommended)**, Haiku 4.5 (Fast)
  - OpenAI: GPT-4o (Powerful), **GPT-4o mini (Recommended)**, GPT-4 Turbo
- **API key input** with show/hide toggle; leave empty = keep existing key; "Key stored" indicator
- **Advanced settings** (collapsible): timeout (ms) and max tokens
- **Test connection** — real mini-call (max 10 tokens) to verify the key
- **Save** — writes to DB, takes effect immediately for all subsequent AI requests
- **When disabled** — info banner; AI button hidden for all users (503 response)

**Architecture changes:**
- `provider-factory.js` — `getAiConfig()` (async, reads from DB), `isAiAvailable(config)`, `getAiProvider(config)` — all functions now accept a config object
- `claude-adapter.js` — accepts config object instead of environment variables
- `openai-adapter.js` — newly implemented (OpenAI SDK), analogous to Claude adapter
- AI route `artifacts/:aid/ai` — calls `getAiConfig()` and passes config to provider
- `AiSession` logging uses dynamic provider name from config

**New packages:** `openai`

**API:** `GET/PATCH /api/admin/ai`, `POST /api/admin/ai/test`

---

### Extension Step 11 — PRD Gap Analysis: 9 Additional Artifact Types ✅

**Goal:** Fill structural gaps in the domain model so a complete PRD can be represented — foundations, governance, measurement, and quality assurance.

**New "Foundations" group** (slate color, first in explorer):

| Type | Field component | Highlight |
|---|---|---|
| Goals & Non-Goals | `GoalsNonGoalsFields` | Green "In Scope" box + red "Out of Scope" box + rationale |
| Stakeholder | `StakeholderFields` | RACI radio card selector (Responsible / Accountable / Consulted / Informed) + name/role grid |
| Assumption | `AssumptionFields` | Amber highlighted assumption box + rationale + impact if wrong + validation approach |
| Constraint | `ConstraintFields` | Orange highlighted constraint box + type selector (Technical / Budget / Regulatory / Time / Resource) + impact |
| Open Question | `OpenQuestionFields` | Yellow question box + context + owner/due date grid + resolution field |

**Extended existing groups:**

| Group | Type | Highlight |
|---|---|---|
| Strategy | Measurement Plan | Objective + key metrics + baseline/target + instrumentation + review cadence |
| Delivery | Test Plan | Scope + approach + entry/exit criteria grid + test risks + owner |
| Delivery | Compliance Requirement | Red highlighted requirement box + regulation/deadline grid + scope + implementation |
| Planning & Release | Milestone | Description + target date/owner grid + success criteria + status pill selector |

**Infrastructure:**
- `ARTIFACT_GROUPS` extended with "foundations" as the first group
- `ARTIFACT_GROUP_COLORS` — slate color token set for foundations group
- `RELATION_SUGGESTIONS` extended to connect all 9 new types into the artifact graph
- 9 new AI prompt templates (`goals-non-goals.js`, `stakeholder.js`, `assumption.js`, `constraint.js`, `open-question.js`, `measurement-plan.js`, `test-plan.js`, `compliance-requirement.js`, `milestone.js`)
- `fields/index.js` and `prompts/index.js` updated — all new types fully registered

---

### Bugfix — FieldHelpers dual API + PRD question 5 coverage ✅

**FieldHelpers API bug (critical):**

The 9 new Foundations field components (GoalsNonGoals, Stakeholder, Assumption, Constraint, OpenQuestion, MeasurementPlan, Milestone, TestPlan, ComplianceRequirement) used a value-based calling convention (`value=`, `onChange(v)`, inline `label=`) that `FieldHelpers` didn't support. All new fields rendered blank and edits were silently dropped.

`FieldHelpers.jsx` now supports both conventions side by side:

| Convention | When used | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| A — key-based | Original 6 types + most Step 5 types | `<FieldTextarea fieldKey="x" fields={fields} onChange={onChange} />` |
| B — value-based | 9 new Foundations types | `<FieldTextarea label="X" value={fields.x} onChange={(v) => onChange("x", v)} />` |

`FieldTextarea` and `FieldInput` detect which convention is active via the presence of `fieldKey` and route accordingly. The `label` prop renders a `FieldLabel` inline when provided.

**PRD coverage — Question 5:**

A gap analysis against the 10 minimum PRD questions revealed one missing field: *"Why is the current solution insufficient?"* The `Problem Statement` artifact had `currentSolution` (how users solve it today) but no field for the gap that justifies building something new.

- New field `whyInsufficient` added to `ProblemStatementFields`
- AI prompt for `problem-statement` updated to include the field and guide the model to articulate the gap (too slow / expensive / unreliable / doesn't scale / poor UX / risky)

**All 10 PRD starter questions are now covered:**

| # | Question | Artifact / field |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | What is the product idea? | Product Vision → `oneLiner` |
| 2 | What problem does it solve? | Problem Statement → `problem` |
| 3 | Who has this problem? | User Persona + Buyer Persona |
| 4 | How do users solve it today? | Problem Statement → `currentSolution` |
| 5 | Why is the current solution insufficient? | Problem Statement → `whyInsufficient` |
| 6 | What is the desired outcome? | Goals & Non-Goals → `goals` |
| 7 | What is the first use case? | Use Case |
| 8 | Must-have features for v1? | Feature → `priority` + Goals & Non-Goals |
| 9 | What is out of scope for v1? | Goals & Non-Goals → `nonGoals` |
| 10 | How will success be measured? | KPI/OKR + Measurement Plan |

**German → English label translation:**

The original 4 field components still had German UI labels:
- `UserPersonaFields` — Name, Goals, Pain points, Context/Background
- `ProblemStatementFields` — all labels
- `ProductVisionFields` — One-liner, Target users, Value proposition
- `FeatureFields` — Description, User value, In/Out of scope, Priority

---

### Extension Step 12 — Traceability View Enhancements ✅

**Goal:** Make the traceability view actionable — surface gaps in the artifact graph and let users drill into specific relation types and statuses.

**Summary bar:**
- New **domain coverage** stat — shows what % of all 35 artifact types have at least one instance in the project, with a color-coded progress bar (orange → blue → green at 100%)

**Filter toolbar** (3 rows):
- Row 1: All / Linked / Isolated (unchanged)
- Row 2: **Status filter** — All statuses / Draft / In Review / Done
- Row 3: **Relation type filter** — All / Derives From (n) / Depends On (n) / Relates To (n) / Validates (n); only shows types that exist in the project, with counts

**Per-group improvements:**
- **Coverage bar** in each group header — thin bar showing what % of the group's artifact types have at least one artifact, with color-coded threshold (green ≥ 100%, blue ≥ 50%, orange < 50%)
- **Gap detection (missing types)** — collapsible section at the bottom of each group listing which types are absent, with direct "+ [Type name]" links that open the Explorer pre-set to create that type
- Empty groups show a dashed placeholder with a "Create first" call to action instead of being hidden

**Connection badges:**
- Relation type filter applies to the badge list — per-artifact row shows only connections of the selected type; shows a note if connections exist but none match the filter

---

### Extension Step 14 — Interactive Artifact Graph ✅

**Goal:** Make artifact relations a first-class visual feature — a full interactive node graph where artifacts are nodes, relations are directed edges, and new connections can be created by dragging directly on the canvas.

**New dependency:** `@xyflow/react` (React Flow v12)

**API:**
- `GET /api/projects/:id/graph` — returns `{ artifacts: [...], relations: [...] }` using a two-step SQLite-safe query (no nested OR)

**Graph page (`/projects/:id/graph`):**
- Server-rendered page, accessible via the **Graph** button (network icon) in the explorer header
- Full-viewport canvas with pan, zoom (0.15×–2×), and fit-view on load
- Header with breadcrumb back to the Explorer

**`ArtifactGraph` client component:**
- All artifacts rendered as custom nodes, laid out in **columns by domain group** (one column per group, artifacts stacked vertically — empty groups skipped)
- All relations rendered as directed smooth-step edges, color-coded by type:
  - Derived from → blue
  - Depends on → orange (animated dashes)
  - Related to → gray
  - Validates → green
- **MiniMap** for overview navigation
- **Controls** (zoom in/out/fit) in bottom-left
- **Legend panel** (top-right) — relation type colors + interaction hints
- **Group color legend** (bottom-left) — one dot per domain group

**Interaction model:**
- **Double-click** a node → opens the artifact in the Explorer (`/projects/:id?artifact=ID`)
- **Drag** from a node's right handle to another node's left handle → opens `GraphRelationDialog`
- **Pan/zoom** — standard touch and mouse gestures

**`ArtifactNode` custom node:**
- Group-colored header bar (matches Explorer, Progress, Traceability colors)
- Artifact type label (uppercase, small)
- Artifact title (bold, 2-line clamp)
- Status dot + label
- Source handle (right) and target handle (left) for drag-connect

**`GraphRelationDialog`:**
- Shows source artifact → target artifact with type labels
- Relation type dropdown, pre-populated with a smart suggestion (same `RELATION_SUGGESTIONS` map used in the Explorer)
- Recommended type marked
- On confirm: POSTs to the existing relations API; new edge appears on canvas immediately without a full refetch
- On duplicate or error: inline error message

**Files added/changed:**
- `src/app/api/projects/[projectId]/graph/route.js` (new)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[projectId]/graph/page.js` (new)
- `src/components/graph/ArtifactGraph.jsx` (new)
- `src/components/graph/ArtifactNode.jsx` (new)
- `src/components/graph/GraphRelationDialog.jsx` (new)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[projectId]/page.js` — Graph button added to header

---

### Bug-fix Pass — Code Review Findings ✅

A full codebase review identified and fixed 9 bugs across all severity levels.

**Critical fixes:**

| # | File | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `StarterContextPanel.jsx` | Rules of Hooks violation — `useSWR` was called after a conditional `return null`, causing React to throw when the artifact type changed | Moved hook before early return; passes `null` SWR key when type has no mapping |
| 2 | `ArtifactForm.jsx` | Status de-sync — `ArtifactHeader`'s quick-cycle button PATCHes status directly; `ArtifactForm`'s local state only resets on artifact ID change, so saving the form could overwrite the toggle | Status `<Select>` hidden in edit mode; `status` removed from PATCH body — `ArtifactHeader` exclusively owns status in edit mode |

**High fixes (silent failures):**

| # | File | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | `ArtifactHeader.jsx` | `handleDelete` never checked `res.ok` — on 403/500 the UI still redirected and cleared the artifact | Now checks response; only redirects on success; shows error banner on failure |
| 4 | `ArtifactHeader.jsx` | `handleStatusChange` had no `else` branch — API errors were silently discarded with no user feedback | Added error state, error banner, and `catch` for network errors |
| 5 | `VersionList.jsx` | `handleRestore` closed the confirm dialog on both success and failure — user had no way to know a restore failed | Error shown inline; dialog only closes on success |

**Medium fixes:**

| # | File | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | `starter/route.js` | `JSON.parse(project.prdStarter)` was unguarded — corrupted DB data would throw a 500 with no proper error shape | Wrapped in try/catch; falls back to `STARTER_DEFAULTS` |
| 7 | `project-access.js` | Archived projects were read-only in the UI but fully writable via the API — `project.status` was fetched but never checked | Write operations on `ARCHIVED` projects now return 403 |
| 8 | `artifacts/[artifactId]/route.js` | `GET` called `requireArtifactAccess` (one DB fetch) then immediately did a second `findUnique` for the same row | GET now returns the artifact already fetched by `requireArtifactAccess` |
| 9 | `tags/route.js` | `DELETE /artifact/tags` skipped `requireArtifactAccess` — project membership was checked but not artifact ownership; duplicate import | Added artifact access check; merged duplicate import |

**Low fixes:**

| # | File | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | `TraceabilityView.jsx` | Connection badges used array index as React key — unstable when filter order changes | Replaced with stable key `${direction}-${artifact.id}-${relationType}` |

---

### Extension Step 13 — PRD Starter (10-Question Onboarding) ✅

**Goal:** Capture the minimum information needed to start a PRD at project creation — 10 structured questions — and surface relevant answers inline while editing each artifact, so high-level decisions stay consistent with detailed content.

**Data model:**
- `Project.prdStarter String?` — the 10 starter answers stored as a JSON string
- Migration: `prisma/migrations/20260427172426_add_prd_starter`

**API:**
- `GET  /api/projects/:id/starter` — returns parsed answers (VIEWER+), falls back to empty defaults if not filled in yet
- `PATCH /api/projects/:id/starter` — saves 10 known keys, strips unknown keys (EDITOR+)

**Starter page (`/projects/:id/starter`):**
- Server-rendered page; accessible via the "Starter" button (Rocket icon) in the explorer header for all roles
- `StarterForm` client component:
  - 10 questions with label, hint text, and a multi-line textarea per question
  - Completion bar: X/10 answered, with CheckCircle2 / Circle icon per question
  - Each question shows which artifact types use that answer as **colored type badges** (existing artifacts) or **dashed "+ Create" links** (missing artifacts)
  - Save button with "✓ Saved" confirmation; form fields disabled for VIEWERs

**Project creation flow:**
- After creating a new project, `ProjectForm` now redirects to `/projects/:id/starter` instead of the explorer — so users fill in the 10 questions before creating their first artifact

**Inline context panel (`StarterContextPanel`):**
- Thin collapsible blue panel shown above the artifact form when editing or creating an artifact
- Fetches starter answers via SWR (cached, no extra round-trip after first load)
- Shows only the answers relevant to the current artifact type (e.g. `productIdea` for Product Vision, `problemSolved + currentSolution + whyInsufficient` for Problem Statement)
- If the relevant answers are empty, shows a "Complete the starter →" prompt with a link
- Renders nothing when the artifact type has no starter mapping — zero noise

**Starter → artifact mapping (`src/lib/starterContext.js`):**

| Artifact type | Starter questions shown |
|---|---|
| Product Vision | What is the product idea? |
| Problem Statement | What problem does it solve? + How do users solve it today? + Why insufficient? |
| User Persona | Who has this problem? |
| Buyer Persona | Who has this problem? |
| Goals & Non-Goals | What is the desired outcome? + What is out of scope? |
| Use Case | What is the first use case? |
| Feature | Must-have features for v1? + What is out of scope? |
| Epic | Must-have features for v1? |
| KPI/OKR | How will success be measured? |
| Measurement Plan | How will success be measured? |

**Bugfixes shipped with this step:**

*Session expiry on reseed:*
- Seed users now have **stable fixed IDs** (`seed-user-admin`, `seed-user-alice`, `seed-user-bob`) so JWT sessions remain valid after a reseed — no forced logout on every `npm run db:seed`

*Stale JWT → 500 instead of 401:*
- `requireAuth()` now verifies the session user still exists in the DB after reading the JWT
- If the user ID is not found (stale token after a DB reset), a clean 401 "Session expired — please log in again" is returned instead of a FK constraint violation crashing the request

*PrismaClientValidationError after schema change:*
- Root cause: `prisma migrate dev` runs migrations but does not always regenerate the client
- Fix: `npx prisma generate` must be run explicitly after every schema change — documented in dev workflow

---

### Extension Step 15 — Document Import with AI Pre-fill ✅

**Goal:** Let users upload existing PRDs, specs, or any project documents and have the AI automatically extract structured artifacts from the content — reducing the cold-start problem for new projects.

**New dependencies:** `pdf-parse` (PDF text extraction), `mammoth` (DOCX text extraction). Both added to `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.mjs` to prevent bundling.

**User flow:**
1. Click **Import** (upload icon) in the project header — visible to Editors and Owners only
2. Upload up to 5 files (PDF / DOCX / TXT / MD, max 10 MB each) via drag-and-drop or file picker
3. Click **Mit KI analysieren** — server extracts text, calls AI, returns proposed artifacts
4. Review the proposal list: expand any card to preview field content, check/uncheck individual artifacts
5. Click **X Artefakte erstellen** — all selected artifacts are created in one bulk transaction and the user is redirected to the Explorer

**Extractable artifact types (13):**
`PRODUCT_VISION`, `PROBLEM_STATEMENT`, `GOALS_NON_GOALS`, `USER_PERSONA`, `BUYER_PERSONA`, `STAKEHOLDER`, `ASSUMPTION`, `MARKET_ANALYSIS`, `COMPETITOR`, `VALUE_PROPOSITION`, `KPI_OKR`, `USE_CASE`, `FEATURE`

**API:**
- `POST /api/projects/:id/import` — accepts `multipart/form-data` with `files[]`; extracts text per file type; calls AI with a structured extraction prompt; returns `{ proposals: [{ type, title, fields }] }` — **does not save anything**
- `POST /api/projects/:id/artifacts/bulk` — accepts `{ artifacts: [...] }`; creates all in a single Prisma transaction with version records; max 50 per call

**AI extraction layer (`src/lib/ai/document-extractor.js`):**
- `buildExtractionPrompt(text)` — constructs a prompt with type schemas, field descriptions, and output format instructions; truncates input at 20 000 chars to stay within context limits
- `parseExtractionResponse(text)` — extracts the JSON code block from the AI reply, validates each proposal against the type schema, sanitises field keys, caps title length at 80 chars
- All adapters (Claude + OpenAI) gained an `extractFromDocument(prompt)` method via the base `AiProvider` interface

**Files added/changed:**
- `src/lib/ai/document-extractor.js` (new)
- `src/lib/ai/provider.js` — `extractFromDocument()` added to base interface
- `src/lib/ai/claude-adapter.js` — `extractFromDocument()` implemented (4096 max tokens)
- `src/lib/ai/openai-adapter.js` — `extractFromDocument()` implemented
- `src/app/api/projects/[projectId]/import/route.js` (new)
- `src/app/api/projects/[projectId]/artifacts/bulk/route.js` (new)
- `src/components/import/DocumentImport.jsx` (new)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[projectId]/import/page.js` (new)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[projectId]/page.js` — Import button added
- `next.config.mjs` — `pdf-parse` and `mammoth` added to `serverExternalPackages`
- `USER_MANUAL.md` — Section 14: Document Import added (v1.1)

---

### Extension Step 16 — Formal Relation Pickers (ArtifactRefField) ✅

Key free-text fields that asked "who is the target user?" were replaced with live relation pickers that create formal `Relation` records in the database — so persona links appear automatically in the artifact graph, traceability view, and relation badges.

**New component:** `src/components/artifacts/fields/ArtifactRefField.jsx`
- Fetches existing relations + all project artifacts via SWR
- Renders linked items as colored chips with × remove button
- Dropdown filtered to the specified `targetTypes`; creates/deletes Relation records via the existing API

**Updated field components:**

| Component | Field replaced | Linked types |
|---|---|---|
| `ProductVisionFields` | `targetUsers` textarea | USER_PERSONA, BUYER_PERSONA |
| `ProductVisionFields` | `valueProposition` textarea | VALUE_PROPOSITION |
| `UseCaseFields` | `actor` input | USER_PERSONA, BUYER_PERSONA |
| `ValuePropositionFields` | `targetCustomer` input | USER_PERSONA, BUYER_PERSONA |
| `UserStoryFields` | `role` row | USER_PERSONA, BUYER_PERSONA |
| `UserJourneyFields` | `actor` input | USER_PERSONA, BUYER_PERSONA |
| `OpportunityFields` | `targetAudience` input | USER_PERSONA, BUYER_PERSONA |
| `PositioningFields` | `targetSegment` input | USER_PERSONA, BUYER_PERSONA |

### Extension Step 17 — UX Polish Pass ✅

- **Hydration fix:** `ExplorerTreeGroup` outer toggle changed from `<button>` to `<div role="button" tabIndex={0}>` — the `<button>` inside `<button>` HTML violation caused a React hydration error in the browser
- **Error states (UX-6):** `RelationList`, `AiSuggestButton`, `InviteMember`, `MemberList` all standardised to `bg-red-50 border border-red-200 text-red-700` boxes
- **Success feedback (UX-7):** `InviteMember` + `MemberList` show `CheckCircle2` + green banner after successful operations
- **Spinner standardisation (UX-8):** `Loader2 animate-spin` usages replaced with `<Spinner>` component throughout
- **DocumentImport rejection feedback (UX-9):** files over 10 MB or exceeding the 5-file limit now show a visible warning banner

---

### Extension Step 18 — Member Management: Owner-Only Controls ✅

Non-owners previously saw the role dropdown and remove button in project settings — clicking either resulted in a 403 error. Fixed by threading `isOwner` from the settings page down through `MembersSection` → `MemberList`: non-owners see a plain role label. `InviteMember` rewritten to use shared `Input`/`Select`/`Button` components.

---

### Extension Step 19 — Account Self-Service ✅

**API:**
- `GET/PATCH /api/users/me` — read and update display name
- `POST /api/users/me/password` — verify current password (bcrypt), hash and save new password; returns field-level error on mismatch

**UI:**
- `/account` — two-section form: Profile (name + disabled email) and Change Password (current / new / confirm with client-side equality check)
- Sidebar footer — account link showing user name or email, with active-state highlight

---

### Extension Step 20 — Artifact Export (JSON + CSV) ✅

**API:** `GET /api/projects/:id/export?format=json|csv`
- **JSON:** full nested structure `{ project, artifacts: [...with fields...] }`
- **CSV:** fixed columns (id, type, type_label, title, status, createdAt, updatedAt, fields) where `fields` is a JSON string

**UI:** `ExportSection` component in project settings — two buttons with per-format loading states; uses fetch → blob → `createObjectURL` → anchor click to trigger the browser download.

---

### Extension Step 21 — Landing Page Rewrite ✅

All five public pages replaced with PM Copilot-specific content. Root `/` now shows the full landing page for unauthenticated visitors (authenticated users redirect to `/projects`). `SITE` and `NAV_LINKS` constants added — Navbar and Footer were importing them but they didn't exist, so both components were broken. Pages updated: Hero, FeatureHighlights, Testimonials, LogoBar, CtaBanner, `/features`, `/pricing`, `/about`, `/contact`.

---

### Extension Step 22 — Unit Test Suite (Vitest) ✅

**99 tests, 10 files, all passing.** First test coverage in the project.

**Setup:** `vitest` + `@vitest/coverage-v8` + `@testing-library/react` + `jsdom`. Global `next/server` mock in `src/__tests__/setup.js`. Path alias `@/` wired via `vitest.config.js`.

**Coverage:** all Zod validators, `errors.js`, `validateBody`/`validateParams`, `requireAuth` / `requireAdmin` / `requireProjectAccess` / `requireArtifactAccess` middleware (Prisma and next-auth mocked with `vi.mock`), and `parseExtractionResponse` / `buildExtractionPrompt` from the document extractor.

**Commands:** `npm test` · `npm run test:watch` · `npm run test:coverage`

---

### Extension Step 23 — Unified Project Navigation (ProjectNavBar) ✅

Replaced 7 duplicated inline `<header>` blocks across all project sub-pages with a single shared `ProjectNavBar` client component (`src/components/layout/ProjectNavBar.jsx`).

**Two-row layout:**
- **Row 1** — `Projekte / {projectName}` breadcrumb (left); Search, Importieren (non-VIEWER), Einstellungen (OWNER) utility actions (right)
- **Row 2** — Tab strip: Explorer · Starter · Board · Fortschritt · Graph · Traceability with `border-b-2 border-blue-600` active-state highlight driven by `usePathname()`

**Pages updated:** Explorer, Board, Fortschritt, Graph, Traceability, Starter, Import. Also fixed Starter breadcrumb "Projects" → "Projekte".

---

### UX Audit Pass — Items UX-0 through UX-9 ✅

All nine actionable items from the 2026-05-04 UX audit resolved. Key changes per item:

- **UX-0** — Shared `ProjectNavBar` with tab strip and active-state (see Step 23)
- **UX-1** — Verified: all label maps (`ARTIFACT_TYPE_LABELS`, `ARTIFACT_STATUS_LABELS`, `RELATION_TYPE_LABELS`), `TraceabilityView`, `ArtifactGraph`, `GraphRelationDialog` are fully German. No English visible in the authenticated app.
- **UX-4** — `DocumentImport` proposal checkboxes converted to native `<input type="checkbox" className="sr-only">` inside `<label>` with visual icon; drop zone and file remove buttons have `aria-label`; all progress bars have full ARIA (`role="progressbar"`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`)
- **UX-5** — `ArtifactNode` source handle is blue with `cursor: "crosshair"`; target handle has `cursor: "cell"`; both have German `title` tooltips; legend panel explains the drag-to-connect gesture
- **UX-2/3/6/7/8/9** — Previously completed (admin components, ConfirmDialog, error boxes, success banners, Spinner, file rejection warnings)

---

### UX Audit Pass — Items UX-10 through UX-16 ✅

Remaining audit items resolved:

- **UX-10** — Shared `ProjectPageSkeleton` component (`src/components/layout/ProjectPageSkeleton.jsx`): animated two-row skeleton (breadcrumb row + tab-strip row) matching the ProjectNavBar layout, plus a centered spinner. All four sub-page `loading.js` files (board, progress, graph, traceability) now use it.
- **UX-11** — StarterContextPanel already had `transition-all duration-200`, text labels, and `aria-expanded`; no changes needed.
- **UX-12** — Delete dialog description now tells users to check version history before deleting instead of the misleading "nicht rückgängig über die Benutzeroberfläche" phrasing.
- **UX-13** — `StatusPipeline` component in `ArtifactHeader`: three states shown inline with colored dots — current step blue + bold, completed steps green, upcoming steps gray. Cycle direction is now always visible at a glance.
- **UX-14** — TraceabilityView empty-group CTA unified: "+ Erstes anlegen" → "+ Hinzufügen" (matches PhaseCard).
- **UX-15** — Already standardised (`disabled:opacity-50` across Button, Input, Select).
- **UX-16** — `rounded-md` → `rounded-lg` on RelationList and VersionList action buttons. `rounded-xl` for cards and dialogs is intentional.

All 17 items (UX-0 through UX-16) are now closed.

---

### Extension Step 24 — Rich Text Editor for Long-Form Fields ✅

Prose/narrative fields replaced from plain `<textarea>` to a Tiptap-powered rich text editor — without any schema migration.

**New component — `RichTextarea`** (`src/components/ui/RichTextarea.jsx`): minimal toolbar (Bold · Italic · BulletList · OrderedList), toolbar hidden in read-only mode, loaded via `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`. External value changes sync via `editor.commands.setContent(value, false)` — the `false` flag prevents re-triggering `onUpdate`.

**`FieldTextarea`** in `FieldHelpers.jsx` gains a `rich` boolean prop. When `true` it renders `RichTextarea`; both calling conventions (key-based and value-based) work unchanged.

**34 field targets across 24 components** updated to `rich={true}`. Kept as plain text: `flow` (Use Case, numbered steps), `acceptanceCriteria` (FunctionalRequirement, `-` bullet format), `keyResults` (KPI/OKR, `KR1/KR2/KR3`), `steps` (UserJourney, `N. Schritt:` format).

**Storage:** HTML. Existing plain-text data loads transparently — Tiptap renders it as an unformatted paragraph.

---

### Extension Step 25 — Expanded Test Suite (RTL + API Integration) ✅

Extended the Vitest suite from 99 to **150 tests across 14 files**.

**New test files:**

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `__tests__/components/ArtifactForm.test.jsx` | 20 | Create/edit/dirty-flag/VIEWER-role using React Testing Library |
| `__tests__/api/projects.test.js` | 10 | GET list + POST create with role propagation |
| `__tests__/api/artifacts.test.js` | 10 | GET list + POST create with initial version |
| `__tests__/api/artifact.test.js` | 11 | GET/PATCH/DELETE for single artifact, field merge, soft-delete, version increment |

**Notable:** API tests use `{ params: Promise.resolve({...}) }` (Next.js 15 App Router `params` is async). Component tests use `vi.hoisted()` for router mocks and async `vi.mock()` factories with `React.createElement` to avoid Vite 8 Oxc refusing JSX in `.js` context files.

---

### Extension Step 26 — Playwright E2E Test Suite ✅

**17 E2E tests, 4 spec files, all passing.** Runs headless Chromium against the live dev server.

**Commands:** `npm run test:e2e` · `npm run test:e2e:headed` · `npm run test:e2e:ui`

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `e2e/auth.spec.js` | 5 | Redirect guard, validation, wrong credentials, login, logout |
| `e2e/project.spec.js` | 5 | Create project, create/edit artifact, version history, tree display, soft-delete |
| `e2e/relations.spec.js` | 2 | Add relation via dialog, traceability view shows it |
| `e2e/admin.spec.js` | 5 | Admin user management, non-admin redirect, create user → login → empty state |

**Infrastructure:** `playwright.config.js` (Chromium, serial, screenshots + video on failure), `e2e/global-setup.js` (server readiness check), `e2e/helpers/auth.js` (shared login helper).

**Bug fixed during E2E:** `ArtifactRefField.getGroupColor()` used `group.id` instead of `group.key`, causing `ARTIFACT_GROUP_COLORS[undefined]` and a runtime crash on any page with a ProductVision, UseCase, or ValueProposition artifact. Also fixed: `RichTextarea` needed `immediatelyRender: false` in `useEditor` to avoid a Tiptap SSR hydration error in headless environments.

---

### Extension Step 30 — Audit Log UI ✅

Destructive actions are now logged and visible to admins.

**What's logged:** artifact soft-delete, version restore, project archive/unarchive — each with the affected resource's title/name, type, and (for restores) the source version number.

**`src/lib/audit.js`** — `logAction()` fire-and-forget helper with internal error suppression so a failed log write never breaks the user-facing operation.

**`GET /api/admin/audit`** — paginated, filterable by action type (admin-only).

**`/admin/audit`** — table with timestamp · action badge · user · affected resource; action filter chips; page navigation. Linked from the admin sidebar.

**Also fixed:** `DELETE /artifacts/:id` was not capturing the `artifact` variable from `requireArtifactAccess` (was only taking `response`), causing a `ReferenceError` that would have silently swallowed the log call. Fixed while adding the log call.

---

### Extension Step 31 — Artifact Bulk Actions in Explorer ✅

Multi-select mode in the Explorer tree lets EDITOR+ users act on multiple artifacts at once.

**"Auswählen" toggle** in the filter bar (EDITOR/OWNER only) enters bulk select mode. In select mode each tree item shows a checkbox instead of a status dot; clicking toggles selection instead of navigating.

**`BulkActionBar`** appears at the bottom of the tree panel while select mode is active:
- **Status** — dropdown (DRAFT / In Review / Done) → `PATCH /artifacts/bulk`
- **Tag** — dropdown of project tags → `POST /artifacts/bulk/tags`
- **Löschen** — with `ConfirmDialog` → `DELETE /artifacts/bulk` (soft-delete, logged to AuditLog)
- **×** — exits select mode

**New API endpoints:**
- `PATCH /api/projects/:id/artifacts/bulk` — body `{ ids, status }`; `updateMany` on the matched artifacts
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id/artifacts/bulk` — body `{ ids }`; soft-delete + `ARTIFACT_BULK_DELETE` audit log entry
- `POST /api/projects/:id/artifacts/bulk/tags` — body `{ ids, tagIds }`; upserts `ArtifactTag` rows in a Prisma transaction

**`BulkSelectContext`** — React context (`selectMode`, `selectedIds` Set, `enter`, `clear`, `toggle`) wraps the tree client so selection state is shared between the filter bar, tree items, and action bar without prop drilling.

---

### Extension Step 32 — In-App Notifications ✅

Bell icon in the header keeps users aware of activity on their projects — no email or real-time infrastructure required.

**`Notification` table** (migration `add_notifications`): recipient `userId`, `type`, `actorId`, `artifactId?`, `projectId?`, JSON `meta`, `read` flag, `createdAt`. Indexed on `(userId, read)` and `(userId, createdAt)`.

**Trigger:** `POST /artifacts/:aid/comments` now calls `createCommentNotifications()` after the comment is saved. The helper fetches all project members, excludes the author, and calls `prisma.notification.createMany`. Fire-and-forget with internal try-catch.

**API:**
- `GET /api/notifications` — returns `{ notifications, unreadCount }` for the session user (last 30, desc)
- `PATCH /api/notifications/read` — marks specific IDs or all unread as read

**`NotificationBell`** (client component in Header):
- Bell icon with a red badge (capped at 9+)
- SWR polling every 30 s, revalidates on window focus
- Dropdown panel: actor name, artifact title, 2-line comment preview, relative time, project name; unread items in blue
- Click → navigate to artifact + mark as read
- "Alle als gelesen" button

---

### Extension Step 33 — Project Templates ✅

Owners can capture a project's structure as a reusable template and apply it when creating new projects.

**New tables** (migration `add_project_templates`):
- `ProjectTemplate` — name, description, optional `starter` (JSON prdStarter answers), createdById
- `ProjectTemplateArtifact` — type, title, fields (JSON), sortOrder; cascades on template delete

**Saving a template** — "Als Vorlage speichern" button in the project settings "Vorlage" section (Owner only). `SaveAsTemplateDialog` lets the owner set name/description, optionally include PRD starter answers, and pick which artifacts to include via a scrollable checklist with select/deselect all.

**Using a template** — `/projects/new` fetches all templates server-side and passes them to `ProjectForm`. `TemplatePicker` renders a card grid above the form ("Ohne Vorlage" + one card per template). When a template is selected, the `POST /api/projects` body includes `templateId`; the API pre-creates all template artifacts as DRAFT with initial version history and copies the `prdStarter` answers into the new project.

**API:** `GET/POST /api/templates`, `GET/DELETE /api/templates/:id`.

---

### Extension Step 34 — PostgreSQL Migration Validation ✅

Validates that the schema and all 8 migrations apply cleanly against PostgreSQL 15 and that all core tables work correctly.

**`docker-compose.postgres.yml`** — Postgres 15-alpine on port 5433 with a `pg_isready` health check.

**`scripts/smoke-postgres.mjs`** — 10-step Node.js smoke test:
1. Validates `DATABASE_URL` is a PostgreSQL string
2. Runs `npx prisma migrate deploy`
3. Checks raw connectivity (`SELECT 1`)
4. Creates User → Project → Artifact (with v1) → Comment → Notification → ProjectTemplate → AuditLog
5. Queries artifact back with versions + comments to verify relational integrity
6. Cleans up; exits non-zero on any failure

**`.github/workflows/postgres-smoke.yml`** — CI workflow triggered on pushes that change the schema, migrations, or smoke script. Steps: patch `provider = "postgresql"` → `prisma generate` → `migrate deploy` → smoke test → restore `provider = "sqlite"`.

**Local usage:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://pmcopilot:pmcopilot@localhost:5433/pmcopilot_test" \
  npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run test:postgres
docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml down
```

---

### Extension Step 29 — PDF Export / Report Generation ✅

Adds a formatted PDF report download alongside the existing JSON and CSV exports.

**`GET /api/projects/:id/export?format=pdf`** generates an A4 report using `pdfkit`:
- **Cover:** project name, description, status, export date
- **Summary:** 2-column grid showing artifact count per domain group
- **Artifacts:** one section per group, artifacts sorted by type then title; each card shows title, type, status (color-coded dot), and all field values with German labels

Field values are stored as Tiptap HTML; the generator strips tags and converts block elements to newlines so rich text renders cleanly as plain text in the PDF.

**`ExportSection`** now has three buttons: JSON · CSV · PDF-Bericht.

---

### Extension Step 28 — Responsive Design + Accessibility Pass ✅

**Mobile Explorer:** New `ExplorerPanelLayout` client component implements master-detail panel switching. On mobile (< 768 px), only the tree or only the detail panel is visible at a time; a back button clears the selection and returns to the tree. On `md+` the original side-by-side layout is preserved.

**Responsive fixes:** `ProjectNavBar` hides "Importieren"/"Einstellungen" text on mobile (icon only); project name truncates to 120 px on mobile vs 240 px on desktop. `BoardView` uses narrower columns (`w-60 sm:w-72`) and tighter padding. `ExplorerDetail` uses `p-4 sm:p-6`.

**ARIA pass:**
- Explorer tree `<nav>` has `aria-label`
- `ExplorerTreeGroup` toggle has `aria-expanded` + `aria-controls`; plus button has `aria-label`
- `ExplorerTreeItem` buttons have `aria-current="page"` when selected + descriptive `aria-label`
- `ProjectNavBar` breadcrumb and tab strip each wrapped in a `<nav>` with `aria-label`; active tab has `aria-current="page"`
- `BoardView` filter buttons use `aria-pressed`; filter group has `role="group"`
- `BoardColumn` has `role="region"` with count in `aria-label`

**Color contrast:** All group badge colors verified to pass WCAG AA — no changes needed.

---

### Extension Step 27 — Intelligent Full-Document Import (30 artifact types) ✅

**Goal:** Expand document import from 13 hardcoded types to all 30 canonical artifact types that have field schemas, add chunking for large documents, extract and propose artifact relations, and upgrade the review UI with confidence/evidence display.

**What changed:**

- **`document-extractor.js` rewritten** — `getCanonicalExtractableTypes()` derives the extractable list directly from `ARTIFACT_FIELD_DEFS`; adding a new artifact type to the constants automatically makes it importable. Document chunking (12 000 chars / 800 char overlap) with `mergeExtractionResults()` for deduplication across chunks. Each proposed artifact now carries `confidence` (0–1), `evidence` (up to 3 source quotes), and `rationale`.

- **`import/route.js`** — parallel chunk processing, 250k char hard cap, rich stats response (`canonicalTypeCount`, `coveredTypeCount`, `missingTypes`, `warnings`).

- **`artifacts/bulk/route.js`** — extended to accept `{ artifacts, relations }` with `clientId` mapping; relations created in the same Prisma transaction; limit raised to 100.

- **`DocumentImport.jsx`** — upgraded review UI: per-group coverage panel, color-coded confidence badges, evidence quotes with expand/collapse, per-relation checkboxes in a dedicated Relations panel, auto-create mode (creates without manual review).

- **`vitest.config.js`** — added `include: ["src/__tests__/**"]` so Vitest no longer picks up the Playwright `e2e/` specs.

**Tests:** 2 new/updated test files; total suite now 176 Vitest tests (15 files) — all passing.
